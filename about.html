                  like to describe myself.</p>

                    <p>Since three years back I don't drink alcohol anymore, it feels great and refreshing to wake up and realize this. Also I'm only using the latest nicotine inhaler, the electronic cigarette! It works like a charm and tastes wonderfully!</p>
